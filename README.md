# razer-chroma-discord

this is the first (maybe) discord integration for razer chroma keyboards.
this is a early test version.

HOW TO INSTALL

* make sure you have node.js installed.
* download the files/clone this repository.
* open cmd/powershell in the directory where you downloaded it and type "npm install" and press enter.
* open the index.js and enter your token here --> "ENTER TOKEN HERE".
* now you're all set

HOW TO RUN IT (after instalation)

* open cmd/powershell and type "node index.js" and hit enter.
p.s. you need to leave the cmd/powershell window open for it to work.

HOW TO STOP IT (after its running XD )

* just close the cmd/powershell window.
