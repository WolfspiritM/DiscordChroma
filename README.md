This is the first (maybe) discord integration for razer chroma keyboards.
Still in development. 

## Features

- autoupdates
- blink white twice when you get a discord message (a lot of more effects to come)
- loginremember
- once running you won't even notice that its there (only on your keyboard)

## How to intall

Download installer from the releases page (download version 0.2.2 or above to have it autoupdate)

## How to uninstall

Once installed it's in your programs list, you can uninstall it from there or go to appdata/local/programs/DiscordChroma and run the uninstaller
